Grand Central opened in 2010 in downtown Stockholm. This year, Scandic decided to transform it in to a signature hotel, which required a unique brand identity. With an international and cosmopolitan feel, the hotel merges the big city life, with its art, design, theatre, film and music scenes. The hotel is located in Stockholmâ€™s old printing district and is one of few buildings that survived the modernisation of the area. We drew inspiration from this and created an identity centered around newsprint typography. Our work included everything from logotype, signage and stationary to posters, wayfinding and packaging.
