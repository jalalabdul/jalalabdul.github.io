Street Boi was already well-known for their delicious Bao on Petitenget, Bali. The objective of this project is to transform it into the first Asian diner where oriental meets Western 80â€™s culture. Legend has it that this was the secret spot where Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee used to hang and enjoy homemade Asian street food. Street Boi's retro cinema facade, emblematic diner sofas and custom-made movie posters, is a tribute to the meeting of urban Asian lifestyle and the 80's pop-culture Western vibes.
